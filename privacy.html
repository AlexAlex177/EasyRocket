In case of rejection of your request, we will provide relevant justification.</p>
            <p class="private3-1">Please be aware that whilst we will try to accommodate any request you make in respect of your rights they are not absolute rights. This means that we may have to refuse your request or may only be able to comply with it in part.</p>

Please note, however, that we may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements to keep personal data for a longer period.</p>
            <p class="private3-1">You have the right to have certain personal data erased where it is no longer necessary for us to process it, where you have withdrawn your consent pursuant to paragraph 6.4, where you have objected pursuant to paragraph 6.5, where your personal data has been unlawfully processed, or where erasing your personal data is required in accordance with a legal obligation.</p>
            <p class="private3-1">However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
            <p class="private3-2">Withdrawing consent and restriction of processing</p>
            <p class="private3-1">Where we have specifically requested your consent to process your personal data and have no other lawful conditions to rely on, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to info@easyrocket.com specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.</p>
            <p class="private3-1">Additionally, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to next section and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Data Controller override your own.</p>
            <p class="private3-2">Objection to processing</p>
            <p class="private3-1">You have the right to object to processing where lawful basis is that it is in our legitimate interests. Furthermore you have the right to withdraw consent in the event we are processing your personal data on the basis of your consent. However, please note that we may still process your personal data where there are other relevant lawful bases or where we have compelling grounds to continue processing your personal data in our interests which are not overridden by your rights, interests or freedoms;</p>
            <p class="private3-1">You also have the right to object to direct marketing, which can be done by opting-out of direct marketing either via your Account settings or by opting out via the communication itself. You also have a right to object to any profiling to the extent that it relates to direct marketing only.</p>
            <p class="private3-2">Lodging complaints</p>
            <p class="private3-1">You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by the Data Controller before the competent data protection authorities. Please refer to Section 9 for further information.</p>
